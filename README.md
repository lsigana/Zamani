# 🌸 ZAMANI | Where Past Meets Pop

**Zamani** is a creative moodboard-meets-portfolio project that merges nostalgic aesthetics with modern design. It’s a digital space where *past meets pop*—curated around outfits, interiors, and visual inspirations that reflect my personal creative interests.

## 🎨 Why This Project

I created **Zamani** as a personal creative playground—a place to:
- Explore **visual storytelling** through curated fashion and interior content.
- Experiment with **animations and interactivity** using GSAP.
- Blend retro and modern elements into a cohesive, engaging digital experience.

At its core, Zamani is a moodboard for my creative world—a fun way to play with web design and share visuals I simply find beautiful.

## 🛠️ Project Logic & Features

- **GSAP Animations:**  
  Scroll-triggered reveals, parallax scrolling, and smooth transitions bring static content to life.

- **Custom Cursor:**  
  Interactive cursor changes behavior across different sections (e.g. 'READ', 'SHOP'), creating an immersive boutique-like experience.

- **Section-Based Navigation:**  
  Users can scroll through modular sections like:
  - The Fit Files (Fashion)
  - Room Vibes (Interiors)
  - Moodboard (Pure Visuals)
  - Z-Talks (Editorial)
  - Shop (Curated Product Mockups)

- **Interactive Elements:**  
  Image grids, infinite scroll moodboards, and hover-triggered effects encourage exploration.

- **Smooth Scrolling & Header Effects:**  
  Navigation adjusts based on scroll position for a dynamic browsing experience.

## 🎨 Color Scheme & Visual Style

- **Muted backgrounds** to let images stand out.
- **Gold, cream, warm neutrals** inspired by vintage aesthetics.
- Clean, editorial typography:  
  - Serif headlines mixed with sans-serif body text.
- Subtle transitions and animations for a polished, soft-luxury feel.

---

## 💡 What I Learned

- Working with **GSAP** for efficient, performance-friendly animations.
- Designing with an **editorial UX** focus (beyond functional layouts).
- Structuring modular, section-based code for scalability and creative freedom.

## 🚧 Future Ideas

Zamani could expand into:
- A full lifestyle blog or eCommerce experience.
- A CMS-powered platform for dynamic moodboards.
- A digital zine with scroll-driven storytelling.
